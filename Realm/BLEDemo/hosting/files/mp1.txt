Equiries after ones well-being out of the blue are always surprising.

Normally if you get a message like that after midnight it's a booty call but in this case, given the time difference I'd assume that's not the case. And you reached out do it's not a casual "How are you" where you don't expect any answer more than "Great thanks, and you?"

Which does leave me curious as to why you were thinking of me or whether there is more to this request or what sort of answer you are lookingh for - so I'll give you the lot.

Health and Welfare: Great, not an athlete but not dying anytime soon either, home life is good - I have a very hyperactive puppy who flooded half my house yesterday by turning on a tap but this is just part of living a full life. Off to a Gala ball for a local drama school tonight.

Work: Honestly working harder than I have done since I Joined - so much on my plate and loving every minute of it. The reason there is so much on my plate is I can't resist and all you can eat buffet and picked up a bit of loads of things, some tactical some more strategic - I have far more ideas than I can even test.

I do worry if I'm  fulfilling expectations but Joe tells me I am, and I know what my longer term plans look like so I'm working on those. I just wish there were many more working hours in the day (I do keep a work/life balance so I denote working hours).
